# Parallel-Merge-Sort-Algorithm-in-Pthread
Assume an array of numbers as input. sorting such array in decreasing or increasing order has a lot of application in diffrent engineering problems. merge sort is a serial algorithm which is used to sort the arrays and its step is $o(n \log n)$.
Using the parallel processing techniques, we can design a parallelalgorithm for that which its step is from $o(log n)$.
